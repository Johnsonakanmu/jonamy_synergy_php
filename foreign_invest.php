            Jonamjo Synergy Nig Ltd is a firm of reputable consultants specializing in Foreign Direct Investment in
            Africa. We aim to help foreign direct investors interested in setting up and doing business in Africa
            navigate through the legal and regulatory framework which more than often can be cumbersome for entities
            unfamiliar with the business terrain of Africa.
            <br><br>
            We are well-connected with all major governments across Africa and have built a strong network of lobbyists
            and policy formulators. Our team is robust and will work round the clock to ensure the success of our
            clients. We have a track record of successfully matching our clients with relevant partners, enabling great
            achievements across diverse fields.
            <br><br>
            We assist our clients to comply with relevant laws regarding capital importation and guarantee strict
            adherence to the agreed freedom of repatriation of profit and capital by host economies wherever our clients
            decide to invest. Furthermore, our strong teams of immigration lawyers competently undertake applications
            for requisite business permits and expatriate quotas.
            <br><br>
            All relevant applications for tax exemptions and grants of pioneer status, where applicable, are handled
            competently while not overlooking the protection of any new or special technology that our clients may
            possess. Aside from these duties, we consult with our clients using our knowledge of the continent and its
            investment landscape and advise our clients on relevant sectors of the growing economy that are profitable
            with guarantees of return on investment.
